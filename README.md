# 301daysofCode
Sort of diary of my journey in coding. 

<h1>Brief summary of the first 199 days</h1>
<p>I come from an hybrid degree which comprehends both psychology and user interface design and development (UI/UX). While i was studying i learnt html/css and a C derived language, plus other tech things like Artificial Intelligence, Latex, Linux and so on. 
In addiction to this i'm a big fan of Photography and Compositing, so i mastered by myself Photoshop and XD through the years. 

The reason why i decided to begin this journey is because while working as a Communication Specialist i was asked to help with the site of a company which was really terrible in terms of UI/UX. Doing that i found myself thinking about how much i'd have loved to know how to code it all by myself, so here i am. 

I started the 100daysofcode challenge taking a course on Responsive Web Design for static websites so that i could review my html/css and improve it, learning some libraries such as Bootstrap and Bulma and finally wrote a couple of miniprojects. 

As soon as i finished the things i mentioned above, i took another course on Advanced Wordpress learning within it the basics of Javascript(jQuery) and PhP. Final step was to wrote a simple OnePage site and convert it in Wordpress; That's exactly what i did and <br> <strong> BOOM my site was UP and RUNNING </strong>. What a Satisfaction guys!

Those were my first succesful 100 days, i took a break of a week and then decided to go on to reach the 301daysofcode. Sometimes it's stressful with another job and tons of other things to do, like family, friends and other hobbies, but you know, you can do it if you want!

I spent the other 99 days coding my portfolio, a couple of commissioned sites, with a third big one in wait-list and reading a Javascript book.

Just a week ago i purchased and started the Jonas Schmedtmann course on Advanced CSS and SASS 'cause i really want to master them in order to deliver my clients the best and the most beautiful and usable UI possible. (I'm a UI/UX woman, remember? xD). 

My goal in addiction to "steroidize" my CSS for the 101 days stil to go, is to fully understand and improve my Vanilla Javascript and then master a library between Vue.js and React.js

Day 200: Did lectures on Sass and coded some test of it on Codepen.io! I'm totally loving it
